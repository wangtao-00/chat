Thought: There are several websites that mention the current fed interest rate. I will try loading one of them.

Action: GetWebPage[ https://www.bankrate.com/rates/interest-rates/federal-funds-rate/  ]

Result: <div><h1>Fed Funds Rate</h1></div><div><table><thead><tr><th> </th><th>This Week</th><th>Month Ago</th><th>Year Ago</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fed Funds Rate (Current target rate 5.25-5.50)</td><td>5.5</td><td>5.25</td><td>1.75</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

Thought:  The current Fed interest rate is between 5.25% and 5.50%.  I will use the lower rate to perform the compound interest calculation. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for.

Action: Calculate[ 100000 * (1 + 0.0525/12)**(12*2) - 100000 ]

Result: 11045.626479488797

Conclusion: At the current Federal interest rate, you would earn approximately $11,045 after two years on a savings of $100k if compounded monthly.
